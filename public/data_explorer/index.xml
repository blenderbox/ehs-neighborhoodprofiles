      <description>Air Quality About Air Pollution Air quality is a measure of the condition of the air around us. The less air pollution there is, the better the air quality.
Like many cities, New York City&amp;rsquo;s air contains particles, liquid droplets, gases, and other contaminants that could impact health. Two pollutants, particulate matter andground-level ozone, are of particular health concern.
Although New York City&amp;rsquo;s air does not currently meet federal air quality standards, it has improved significantly over the past two decades.</description>

      <description>Bed Bugs About Bed Bugs Bed bugs are small insects that feed mainly on human blood. They are often confused with other insects, and many people are not even aware of their presence until they have been bitten. However, not everyone has a reaction to bed bug bites. You may not discover that you have bed bugs until you see other signs of the pests such as, bed bugs themselves, their eggs or droppings, or the blood stains they leave behind in mattresses, box springs, chairs or other materials.</description>

      <description>Birth Defects About Birth Defects Birth defects (also called congenital malformations) are conditions that happen when a baby does not develop normally during pregnancy. Structural defects may include missing limbs, malformed hearts, spina bifida and genetic conditions like Down syndrome. Most birth defects happen during the first three months of pregnancy and are detected within the first year of life. Some birth defects (such as cleft lip or clubfoot) are easy to see, but others (such as heart defects or hearing loss) are found using special tests (such as x-rays, CT scans, or hearing tests).</description>

      <description>Birth Outcomes About Birth Outcomes Close to 125,000 live births occur in New York City (NYC) each year. Most babies are born healthy, but those born prematurely or with low birth weight are at greater risk of disability or death. This site tracks indicators of fetal growth and development, infant and perinatal mortality, fertility and sex ratio at birth.
 Birth Outcomes and the Environment Because many genetic and lifestyle factors influence growth and development of fetuses and babies, it can be difficult for researchers to study the effects of environmental exposures on birth outcomes.</description>

      <description>Climate Change About Climate Change There is broad consensus within the scientific community that human activity is changing the Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate through increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) — primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) — in the atmosphere.
Scientists have predicted that unless GHG emissions are substantially stemmed by the end of the century, climate change will become irreversible.
A key part of combating climate change is mitigation, which means reducing GHG emissions.</description>

      <description>Heart Attacks About Heart Attacks A heart attack is referred to medically as an acute myocardial infarction. It is caused when the blood flow that brings oxygen to the heart is severely reduced or cut off altogether. Without adequate blood flow, heart cells can quickly become injured or die. Most heart attacks are an acute event that follows years of atherosclerosis - a build up of plaque in the arteries around the heart.</description>

      <description>Lead Hazards About Lead Hazards The main source of childhood lead poisoning in NYC, as in most of the United States, is lead-based paint in older, deteriorated housing. Nationwide, lead poisoning is associated with housing constructed before 1950, when lead-based paint was widely used and contained more lead than in later decades. In 1960, NYC banned the use of lead-based paint in homes and a national ban went into effect in 1978.</description>

      <description>Mice and Rats About Mice and Rats Rats and mice are common, but preventable. In NYC, rats tend to be seen on streets and sidewalks, and in backyards and basements, while mice are almost always found inside homes.
Rats and mice thrive where there are sources of food and shelter and where property owners fail to prevent and adequately respond to their presence.
This site provides survey data on the prevalence of mice or rats inside and outside of buildings.</description>

      <description>Neighborhood Air Quality About Neighborhood Air Quality Air quality can vary from neighborhood to neighborhood. That is why the **New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS)**keeps track of street-level air pollution from about 100 locations throughout New York City every season. NYCCAS is part of OneNYC, New York City&amp;rsquo;s long-term plan for sustainability.
The pollutants we measure are: fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ground-level ozone (O3, summer), nitrogen oxides (NOx), black carbon from diesel exhaust, sulfur dioxide (SO2, winter) and nickel (Ni, winter).</description>

      <description>Pesticides About Pesticides Pesticides are chemicals applied to kill or control insects, rats and mice, undesirable plants and weeds, or fungi (e.g., mold). Pesticides are often categorized by type of use (e.g., rodenticide, insecticide) or chemical class (e.g., organophosphate, pyrethroid).
Modern pesticides have been developed to have less persistence in the environment than earlier chlorine-based chemicals such as DDT. Pesticides may be applied by a commercial applicator or a non-professional who has purchased a product from a store.</description>

      <description>Restaurant Food Safety About Restaurant Food Safety New York City has approximately 24,000 restaurants that the Health Department inspects every year to monitor compliance with city and state food safety regulations. At the end of an inspection, the Health Department gives restaurants a score, which is eventually converted to a grade of A, B or C. This site describes the distribution of A grades across New York City restaurants.
Restaurant Food Safety and Health Safe food handling can protect diners from foodborne illness.</description>

      <description>Social and Economic Conditions Social and economic conditions Social and economic conditions affect people’s health. These conditions (also called “social determinants of health”) are conditions that people may be born into or fall into over the course of their lives. They are shaped by local, national and global distribution of resources and power.
People tend to be healthier when they have access to:
 Economic and financial stability Higher education Adequate health care Healthy neighborhoods and safe, strong communities   But when people don’t have access to these conditions, they experience worse health outcomes.</description>

      <description>Sugary Drink Consumption About Sugary Drinks Sugary drinks contribute to a higher-calorie diet, long-term weight gain, and increased risk of heart disease and diabetes. Sugary drinks provide little or no nutritional value, and because they don’t fill you up the way food does, you end up consuming more calories. Also, food and beverage portion sizes have exploded over the past several decades, and studies have shown that when given larger portions, people consume more without recognizing it.</description>

      <description>Transportation-related Injuries About traffic injuries in New York City Traffic injuries are no accident. Like other public health concerns, they are preventable through data driven solutions. In NYC, traffic injuries, which include injuries among pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, and motor vehicle occupants, are a leading cause of injury-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits.
In February 2014, NYC launched “Vision Zero”, an action plan to reduce injuries and deaths on city streets. Vision Zero is a multi-agency effort, incorporating road engineering, traffic enforcement, community outreach and education, and policy work to make NYC streets safer.</description>

      <description>Air quality is a measure of the condition of the air around us. The less air pollution there is, the better the air quality.
Like many cities, New York City&amp;rsquo;s air contains particles, liquid droplets, gases, and other contaminants that could impact health. Two pollutants, particulate matter and ground-level ozone, are of particular health concern.
Although New York City&amp;rsquo;s air does not currently meet federal air quality standards, it has improved significantly over the past two decades.</description>
