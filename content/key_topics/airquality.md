New York City's air contains particles, drops of liquid, gasses, and other pollution that can affect health. Bad air quality can be particularly dangerous for older adults, children, and people with heart or lung conditions.

Air quality varies from neighborhood to neighborhood, based on local levels of emissions and many other factors. We monitor air quality using the New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS), NYC's comprehensive air quality monitoring and modeling network. NYCCAS allows us to understand neighborhood differences in air quality - and what contributes to those differences.
