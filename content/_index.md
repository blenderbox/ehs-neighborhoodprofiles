The Environment & Health Data Portal is run by the NYC Environmental Public Health Tracking Program, a program of the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. This program is part of the National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network, an effort led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to share data and analyze trends in environmental public health across the nation.

The NYC Environment & Health Data Portal lets you access data on a variety of topics that show how the environment affects health.

Itâ€™s used by public health professionals, community-based organizations, community boards, city agencies, elected officials, health workers, advocates, and everyday New Yorkers to get important information that they need to do their jobs and make important, informed decisions about health.
