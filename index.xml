Active design promotes health by using architectural and urban design strategies to encourage stair climbing, walking, bicycling, transit use, active recreation and healthy eating.
What we can do:
Increase access to public parks and recreation. Create pedestrian plazas. Ensure well-maintained sidewalks. Plant street trees. Provide secure bicycle storage.</description></item><item><title>Air Quality</title><link>https://blenderbox.github.io/ehs-neighborhoodprofiles/data_explorer/air-quality/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 18:02:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blenderbox.github.io/ehs-neighborhoodprofiles/data_explorer/air-quality/</guid><description>Air Quality About Air Pollution Air quality is a measure of the condition of the air around us.

Structural defects may include missing limbs, malformed hearts, spina bifida and genetic conditions like Down syndrome. Most birth defects happen during the first three months of pregnancy and are detected within the first year of life. Some birth defects (such as cleft lip or clubfoot) are easy to see, but others (such as heart defects or hearing loss) are found using special tests (such as x-rays, CT scans, or hearing tests).</description></item><item><title>Birth Outcomes</title><link>https://blenderbox.github.io/ehs-neighborhoodprofiles/data_explorer/birth-outcomes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 18:02:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blenderbox.github.io/ehs-neighborhoodprofiles/data_explorer/birth-outcomes/</guid><description>Birth Outcomes About Birth Outcomes Close to 125,000 live births occur in New York City (NYC) each year. Most babies are born healthy, but those born prematurely or with low birth weight are at greater risk of disability or death. This site tracks indicators of fetal growth and development, infant and perinatal mortality, fertility and sex ratio at birth.
 Birth Outcomes and the Environment Because many genetic and lifestyle factors influence growth and development of fetuses and babies, it can be difficult for researchers to study the effects of environmental exposures on birth outcomes.</description></item><item><title>Brownfields</title><link>https://blenderbox.github.io/ehs-neighborhoodprofiles/data_explorer/brownfields/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 18:02:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blenderbox.github.io/ehs-neighborhoodprofiles/data_explorer/brownfields/</guid><description>Brownfields Brownfields PlaNYC is a comprehensive sustainability plan for New York City&amp;rsquo;s future.

Scientists have predicted that unless GHG emissions are substantially stemmed by the end of the century, climate change will become irreversible.

Pesticides are often categorized by type of use (e.g., rodenticide, insecticide) or chemical class (e.g., organophosphate, pyrethroid).
Modern pesticides have been developed to have less persistence in the environment than earlier chlorine-based chemicals such as DDT. Pesticides may be applied by a commercial applicator or a non-professional who has purchased a product from a store.</description></item><item><title>Physical Activity</title><link>https://blenderbox.github.io/ehs-neighborhoodprofiles/data_explorer/physical-activity/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 18:02:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blenderbox.github.io/ehs-neighborhoodprofiles/data_explorer/physical-activity/</guid><description>Physical Activity About Physical Activity Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle.
